# VNTconvert
Converts .vnt files created by some older Samsung Android note-taking apps to .txt files

(This was first created in around March 2016, when I had just started learning Python, and so is not very pretty. But it works!)

## Usage
There are no dependencies; just run from the command line in a directory containing VNT files.

Note that while I have tried to account for errors, files are replaced by default and so it may mangle files that are in an unexpected format.
